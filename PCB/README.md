# WIND Breakout

## wind makes the feather fly.

WIND is a breakout board for the Adafruit Feather Series to make it easier to fly wire and put together a project with little to no soldering. 

It contains a battery holder for a 18650(I hate loose batteries!), a few buttons, and 5 pin headers for each pin(plus a proto section). There is a power switch connected to the Enable pin(shuts off the regulator), and a voltage divider to the A0 analog 
for monitoring battery voltage.  

This makes it easy to mount in a housing, and wire up different sensors you want to test.
